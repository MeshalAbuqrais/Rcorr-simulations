# Rcorr Simulations

This repository contains simulations and data examples for Riemannian correlation on different manifolds, as discussed in the paper

M. Abuqrais and D. Pigoli, A Riemannian covariance for manifold-valued data, 2024.

## Folders

- **SO(3) simulation**
- **sphere simulation**
- **vectorcardiogram data**

Each folder contains code and output related to the corresponding manifold or data example.

## How to Run

Navigate to the relevant folder and run the Python script in the `source` folder to reproduce the analysis.
The outputs generated for the article can be found in the `output` folder.
